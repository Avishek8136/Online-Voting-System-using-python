# Voting System üó≥Ô∏è

## Description

1. Candidate registration interface for the election commissioner.
2. Login page for users/voters to select their candidate for two positions: MLA and MP.

## Features
- **Election Commissioner Interface**: Allows the election commissioner to register candidates for the election.
- **User/Voter Interface**: Allows users/voters to log in and cast their votes for MLA and MP positions.
- **Admin Password Protection**: Certain modules require the admin password to proceed, ensuring security and control.
- **Visualization of Results**: Utilizes Matplotlib to visualize the election results at the end.
